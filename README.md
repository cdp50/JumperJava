# Overview

With this software I'm trying to get familiar with the code language Java by creating a simple game using variable declarations,
if statements, loops, functions, and classes. 

# Development Environment

In order to accomplish this task I used Visual Studio Code although I learned that to code in Java is better to use Rider. 

# Useful Websites

Here are the main websites that helped me understand how to use Java
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGvSGybWnP7XhS18swfqJZBRQ-TNj6xUC) the link of youtube is actually a 
link to the whole playlists I made of videos that helped complete the project.
