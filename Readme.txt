# Overview

With this software I'm trying to get familiar with the code language Java by creating a simple game using variable declarations,
if statements, loops, functions, and classes. 

you can watch my video explaining my Work here.

# Development Environment

in order to acomplish this task I used Visual Studio Code although I learned that to code on Java is better to use Rider. 

I didn't know much about this language before this project and now that I did it I feel much more comfortable with it I
understand why people say that is similar to C#.

# Useful Websites

Here are the main websites that helped me understand how to use Java
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGvSGybWnP7XhS18swfqJZBRQ-TNj6xUC) the link of youtube is actually a 
link to the whole playlists I made of videos that helped complete the project.

# Future Work

part of what I think I can still improve is 

* better understanding of data types in Java. 
* data structure in Java.
* classes, design in Java.
